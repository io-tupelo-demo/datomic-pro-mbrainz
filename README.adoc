= io-tupelo-demo/datomic-pro-mbrainz

This demo project contains sample code & test results for the Datmoic Mbrainz example.

It assumes you have installed Datomic Pro on-prem (i.e. not Datomic Cloud)

== Getting Started

First, you need a copy of Datomic. Follow along
link:https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/getting-started/dev-setup.html[as described on the Datomic website]
for "Local Dev Setup".

Second, you must install the Mbrainz music data into Datomic 
link:https://docs.datomic.com/on-prem/query/pull.html[as described here]. Don't forget to start the
transactor.  Also, we assume you name your database as in the URI `datomic:dev://localhost:4334/mbrainz-1968-1973` 

== Fix your version spec in `project.clj`

We assume you have the on-prem version of Datomic Pro.  If so, edit the Lein coordinates
in `project.clj` so match your version number (in the double quotes), e.g.

    [com.datomic/datomic-pro "1.0.6269"]

where the version number `1.0.6269` should match whatever is in the `VERSION` file at the root of your
Datomic distribution.

== Examine the code

Basic queries are shown in this unit test file:

    test/tst/tupelo_datomic/basic.clj

Queries using the "pull" syntax are shown here:

    test/tst/tupelo_datomic/pull.clj


== Run the unit tests

Easy as pie:

    lein clean ; lein test

You should see something like this:

```
> lct

lein test tst._bootstrap

-----------------------------------
   Clojure 1.11.1    Java 17.0.2
-----------------------------------

lein test tst.tupelo-datomic.basic

lein test tst.tupelo-datomic.pull

Ran 3 tests containing 12 assertions.
0 failures, 0 errors.

```
